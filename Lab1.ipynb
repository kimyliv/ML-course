It converges in fewer epochs and generally achieves better accuracy on the test set. However, the difference in accuracy between the transformer and the TF-IDF+ANN model is relatively modest for this particular dataset. In contrast, the computational cost of the transformer is significantly higher. Therefore, if computational resources are limited, the TF-IDF+ANN model is preferable. On the other hand, if achieving higher accuracy is crucial and the sequential order of words substantially influences the neural network’s performance, the transformer model is the better choice.\n","\n","*How did the two models’ complexity, accuracy, and efficiency differ? Did one model outperform the other in specific scenarios or tasks? If so, why?*\n","\n","The TF-IDF+ANN implementation is considerably less complex and more efficient. This efficiency is most noticeable during CPU-based training: 40 epochs using 20 neurons in the hidden layers can be completed in just a few seconds, whereas the transformer implementation—also using a configuration involving 20 neurons—requires 20 minutes to complete only 6 epochs. Despite these differences in training time, both models achieve similar levels of accuracy.\n","\n","Moreover, one significant advantage of the transformer model is its ability to attain reasonable accuracy with less data. For instance, when training on a small dataset, the TF-IDF+ANN model reached an accuracy of 82% on the test set, while the transformer achieved 87%—a level of performance comparable to that attained on a larger dataset (approximately 87.3% accuracy). Consequently, if the available training data is limited, the transformer model is likely to provide more reliable performance. Conversely, when ample training data is available but computational resources are constrained, the TF-IDF+ANN model can deliver satisfactory results with greater efficiency for simpler tasks.\n","\n","*What insights did you obtain concerning data amount to train?
